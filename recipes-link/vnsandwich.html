    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Vietnamese banh mi sandwich is awesome, and it is a nice break from common sandwiches. The garlic chili sauce is common in Asian sections of markets but Indonesian sambal or Korean chili paste can also be substituted. Beer or red wine is the beverage of choice for this authentic recipe of French-influenced Vietnamese cuisine.</p>
