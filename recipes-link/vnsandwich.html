    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Vietnamese banh mi sandwich is awesome, and it is a nice break from common sandwiches. The garlic chili sauce is common in Asian sections of markets but Indonesian sambal or Korean chili paste can also be substituted. Beer or red wine is the beverage of choice for this authentic recipe of French-influenced Vietnamese cuisine.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless pork loin chops, cut 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>4 (7 inch) French bread baguettes, split lengthwise </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>

        <li>1 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro </li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler. Place the pork chops on a broiling pan and set under the broiler. Cook for about 5 minutes, turning once, or until browned on each side.</li>
